1---we can create file by giving the path with the file name as well like bellow, 
    also we can specify the type of the file like abc.txt or abc.doc etc
2---we also can create folder by java file object cuz java file concept is implemented from UNIX commands
  i.e creating a new folder in specified path
		File f2=new File("C:\abhi\GIT_HUB\GIT\GIT_local\core-java\Utilities\src\com\files\basics\second");
   this will create a folder named second in the specified directory

3--- we can create a file in a specified directory by specifying the directory and the file name at same
      time and also by the following constructor as well
      
      File f3= new File("the specified directory" ,  "filename to b created");
	  i.e 
	      File f3= new File("C:\\abhi\\GIT_HUB\\GIT\\GIT_local\\core-java\\Utilities\\src\\com\\" 
				+"files\\basics" ,  "example.txt");
				
				
4---//creating new folder and create a new file inside that
   
   first create a directory or folder by mkdir() or else exception will b thrown then create a file 
   inside that folder reference.
   
   i.e-
		
		File folder=new File("C:\\abhi\\GIT_HUB\\GIT\\GIT_local\\core-java\\Utilities\\src\\com\\" 
				+ "files\\basics","folder");
		folder.mkdir();
		
		File file=new File(folder,"file.txt");
	    file.createNewFile();				
				
Checking weather a file object referring to a file or a directory/folder	

5---File folder=new File("C:\abhi\GIT_HUB\GIT\GIT_local\core\java\Utilities\src\com\files\basics" , "folder");
    folder.createNewFile();
		
  Checking , weather it is a folder
  System.out.println("is this a file : "+folder.isFile());------returns false

  Checking , weather it is a file
  System.out.println("is this a folder : "+folder.isDirectory());----- returns True


  File file=new File(folder,"file.txt");
  file.createNewFile();
  System.out.println("is this a file : "+file.isFile());------returns true
  System.out.println("is this a folder : "+file.isDirectory() );returns false
  

6-----Counting number of elements in a directory : 
  This returns all names in the form of array of Strings 
  i.e. – 
  here basic is the pre created folder that is being pointed.
  File count = new File("C:\abhi\GIT_HUB\GIT\GIT_local\core\java\Utilities\src\com\files\
  Basics”);
   String[] counts = count . list();
  For(String name : counts ) 
   {
     System.out.println(name);
   };
   
7--- dELETING a file or folder : 
  here it is refering a file named "file.txt" that to be created first and then to b deleted;
  File file = new File("C:\abhi\GIT_HUB\GIT\GIT_local\core-java\Utilities\src\com\files\basics\file.txt”);
  file.createNewFile(); **created**
  Thred.sleep(5000);
  file.delete(); **deleted**
