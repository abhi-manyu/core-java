File Writing in JAVA IO
-------------------------------------
- we can write into our files in the simplest way by creating a object of FileWriter.
and then by write().
i.e
   File file = new File("C:\\abhi\\GIT_HUB\\GIT\\GIT_local\\core-java\\Utilities\\src\\com\\files\\Writing","out.xls");
   file.createNewFile();
   FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(file);
   fw.write("this is the output written to the file");
   fw.flush();
